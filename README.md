# GreenThumb AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

GreenThumb AI assists gardeners by providing tailored gardening advice using local climate data and plant biology. It aims to make gardening more accessible and successful for everyone, enhancing green spaces in urban environments.

## Background

This project solves several key problems:
* **Inexperienced Gardening:** Many people want to start gardening but lack the knowledge to do so effectively.
* **Local Climate Variability:** Local weather conditions greatly affect plant health, and not all gardeners can adapt to these changes.
* **Resource Efficiency:** Over-watering and under-fertilizing are common issues that can be mitigated with better information.

These challenges are widespread among urban dwellers who wish to garden but have limited space and expertise. Personally, as someone who has struggled to maintain a healthy balcony garden, I find the need for a tailored gardening assistant crucial. This project is not only about making gardening more successful but also about promoting sustainable living practices.

## How is it used?

Users input their location, soil type, and the plants they are growing through a simple web interface. GreenThumb AI then processes local environmental data like weather forecasts and historical climate patterns alongside plant-specific needs to provide daily gardening advice.

Examples of how to use the recommendations:
* When to water and how much, based on the weather forecast and plant type.
* What plants are best suited for your current garden environment.
* Tips for plant placement to optimize sunlight exposure.

This makes the application valuable for both novice and experienced gardeners.

Here's a mockup of how GreenThumb AI could be integrated into a gardening app:

## Data sources and AI methods

The data used includes:
* **Weather API:** Real-time and forecasted weather data.
* **Plant Database:** Specific requirements and care instructions for various plants.

AI techniques used:
* **Machine Learning:** Predictive models to forecast plant needs.
* **Data Analytics:** Analyzing historical weather patterns and their impact on plant health.

## Challenges

GreenThumb AI does not address large-scale agricultural needs and is limited to advice that does not account for unexpected conditions like pests or diseases. Ethically, it is important to ensure that data privacy is respected and that users understand the AI's limitations.

## What next?

Future enhancements could include:
* Integration with smart home devices for automated garden care.
* Expansion to support larger gardens or small-scale farms.
* Community features to connect with other gardeners.

To achieve these, additional expertise in IoT development and a better infrastructure for larger data processing would be needed.

## Acknowledgments

* Inspiration from various gardening blogs and forums.
* Weather data provided by OpenWeatherMap API.
* Plant care information adapted from the Royal Horticultural Society's guidelines.
